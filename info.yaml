  top_module:  "cchan_fp8_multiplier"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "8-bit (E4M3) Floating Point Multiplier"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: >
    A small mechanism in front to fill up two 8-bit buffers in halves,
    followed by the actual 8-bit multiplier.
